## 4/3/2024: Unfortunately the DarkSky API has officially shut down. I'm currently looking to switch to an alternative provider so stay tuned.

## 9/6/2022: Until the bot is updated to support slash commands, please @ the bot with your commands instead of using the prefix symbol. i.e `@Weatherman wf Seattle, WA`

# Weatherman

Weatherman is a discord bot that keeps track of the weather

## Installation

Just go to this link! [https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=602665053220503567&scope=bot](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=602665053220503567&scope=bot)

**Must have Embed links permissions!**

## Commands

`?w <location>` Returns the current conditions for a location    
`?wf <location>` Returns the five day forecast for a location    
`?sethome` Sets a home location so if you just type `?w` or `?wf` without any additional input it defaults to your home.    
`?clearhome` Clears a previously set home location.    
`?setprefix` Only server admins can use this one. Sets the prefix for your Discord server. Defaults to `?`    
`?commands` Get the list of commands    
`?stats` Show some basic bot statistics    
`?invite` Get an invite link to spread the love!


All commands can also be used with `@Weatherman` instead of the prefix.

This is a work in progress and liable to change at any time!
